To get started, you run a command from the command line to create the initial project.

In the terminal, cd to the directory you want to create you app.  Then run
	cordova create todo org.tngovnerds.todo ToDoList

Now, you have to add the platforms for which you app will run.  We'll just add ios and android for now.
	cd todo
	cordova platform add ios
	cordova platform add android

Bam.  First error.  
	Error: The command "android" failed. Make sure you have the latest Android SDK installed, and the "android"

...back in a minute while I add the android sdk.  
	(from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#download)
Bam.  Second error.
	Error: ERROR : executing command 'ant', make sure you have ant installed and added to your path.
wtf
Okay, so I did 
	brew update
	brew install ant

And now...
	cordova platform add android

Bam.  Third error.
	Error: Please install Android target 19 (the Android newest SDK). Make sure you have the latest Android tools installed as well. Run "android" from your command-line to install/update any missing SDKs or tools.

Okay.  I just installed the android sdk, so that's weird.  But whatever.  So, 
	android
Which brings up the android sdk manager.  I selected all of the 19.* build tools and install.
