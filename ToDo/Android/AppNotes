I went through the steps on this site as best I could.  The problem was that this tutorial is for Eclipse.

Open Android Studio

Select "New Project..."

I was prompted to make a phone/tablet app that targeted 4.0.3
I could have chosen any of the 4.x versions or back to 3.x, but there wasn't an option to target 2.x

There was also an option for targeting a wearables and tv, but I didn't explore those.

I selected a Tabbed Activity to start.

It took a while to setup the project because several dependencies were downloaded.  I'm not sure what all of these are.  These were installed automatically using the "gradle" build/packaging system.


I tried to run the app right away but got an error.
I had previously installed Xamarin and Android Developer found several Android Virtual Device's called "MonoForAndroid".  These were the only options.

I had to create a new AVD...
I was unable to create a new AVD before I installed CPU/AB Image...back to the Android SDK Manager.
I installed the 4.4.2 Intel x86 Atom System Image
I created a Nexus 5 image...but I had to take random guesses to spec it out.


HAX - Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager
https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager
In order to make the emulator run faster, I installed HAX.
There was an error in the installation process that said the Kernel Extension was not from a registered developer...but I plowed ahead and Android Studio told me HAX was working.

So I ran the app...and got a blank screen. Wasn't sure what I should get though, so maybe that was progress.
...after changing my AVD's skin, I saw the world "Android" on the screen as if the device was booting.  And the app log in android studio starting spitting out "Device Nexus_5 [emulator-5554] is online, waiting for processes to start up.." messages
...but nothing happened. :(

I finally discovered that I had to give some space to the SD Card in the AVD I created.
