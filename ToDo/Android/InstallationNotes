I chose to use Android Studio instead of Eclipse.
I made this choice for 2 reasons:
  My previous experience has taught me that Eclipse can be very hard to use.  The was a few years ago, so perhaps it's better now
  Google seems to be promoting the use of Android Studio.
Note Android studio is still in beta.


Prerequisites
  JDK 1.6 or greater


Downloaded Android Stuido Beta from https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html#download

After installation I was immediately notified of an update and installed it.  This was painless

The Android Developer website told me I should download the latest SDK Tools and the Android Support Library and (optionally) the Google Play Services 

To get to the menu that allowed me to download the SDK Tools, I had to create a new project.

After the project loaded I found the SDK Manager.
I found that a handful of SDK tools were already installed (including the latest Android SDK Tools, Android SDK Platform-tools and Android SDK Build-tools).
There were several of the not installed components that were not that were checked as if to encourage me to install them.  This included some wearable and tv packages that I didn't want to install.

I chose not to install anything additional right away, but to see what I had out of the box.



There is a pretty large list of plugins available for Android Studio...most importantly I found IdeaVim for adding vim key bindings.
